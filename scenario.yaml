# A scenario to test call queuing with a single voice channel.

# --- Events for Zone 1 ---

# 1. Power on Unit A (ID 1) and B (ID 2).
- time: 2.0
  zone_id: 1
  event: UnitPowerOnCommand
  params:
    unit_id: 1

- time: 4.0
  zone_id: 1
  event: UnitPowerOnCommand
  params:
    unit_id: 2

# 2. At 10s, Unit A initiates a call on TG 1001. This should succeed and take the only voice channel.
- time: 10.0
  zone_id: 1
  event: UnitInitiateCallCommand
  params:
    unit_id: 1
    talkgroup_id: 1001

# 3. At 12s, WHILE Unit A's call is active, Unit B tries to initiate a call on another talkgroup.
#    This request should fail and be queued. A QUE_RSP should be sent to Unit B.
- time: 12.0
  zone_id: 1
  event: UnitInitiateCallCommand
  params:
    unit_id: 2
    talkgroup_id: 1002

# 4. At 18s, Unit A ends its transmission. This frees the voice channel and should trigger
#    the controller to service the busy queue.
- time: 18.0
  zone_id: 1
  event: UnitEndTransmissionCommand
  params:
    unit_id: 1
    # The call_id is dynamic; the controller will need to find the call associated with unit 1
    call_id: 10001 # Conceptual ID

# 5. At 25s, Unit B ends its now-active call.
- time: 25.0
  zone_id: 1
  event: UnitEndTransmissionCommand
  params:
    unit_id: 2
    call_id: 12002 # Conceptual ID
