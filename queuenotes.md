Priority Handling on Unblock (Recommended): The best approach is to maintain the blocking queue as a simple FIFO queue (using deque for efficiency) but handle the priority when an item is unblocked. When an item is moved from the blocking queue back to the system queue, then you re-evaluate its priority and insert it into the system queue accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the flow and why it works as intended:

Item enters User Queue: It's scheduled based on the user-provided delay.

Item moves to System Queue: When the scheduled time arrives, the item is moved to the system queue, and its priority is initially assigned based on its arguments (EMERGENCY, PRIORITY, etc.).

System Queue Processing: The system queue processes items based on priority and submission time (FCFS within the same priority).

Blocking Condition: If an item in the system queue encounters a blocking condition (e.g., "BLOCK" command), it's moved to the Blocking Queue. Importantly, its original priority and submission time are stored along with it.

Unblocking: When the blocking condition is resolved (e.g., the timer expires), the item is removed from the Blocking Queue.

Re-evaluation and Re-entry to System Queue: This is the key step:

The item's priority is re-evaluated using the assign_system_priority function. This is crucial because the conditions that made the call an emergency (or any other priority) might have changed during the blocking period.
The item is then re-inserted into the system queue according to its new (or possibly same) priority and original submission time.
Potential Re-blocking: Now, here's where your question comes in: Yes, it's entirely possible that the re-inserted item might immediately encounter the blocking condition again. This could happen if the resource it needs is still unavailable. In this case, it would go back to the Blocking Queue.

Why this is good:

Priority is maintained: Even if an item is blocked multiple times, its priority is always re-evaluated upon unblocking, ensuring that high-priority items are not stuck behind lower-priority items.
No starvation: By re-evaluating the priority and re-inserting into the system queue, we avoid starvation. The item gets another chance to be processed based on its current priority relative to other items in the system queue.
Simple Blocking Queue: The Blocking Queue itself remains a simple FIFO queue, which is efficient for managing blocked items.
Example:

Imagine an EMERGENCY call is blocked because all channels are busy. While it's blocked, another EMERGENCY call comes in and is also blocked. When a channel finally opens up, the first EMERGENCY call (the one that has been waiting longer) is unblocked. Its priority is re-evaluated (it's likely still an EMERGENCY), and it's re-inserted into the system queue. Because it's now at the top of the system queue, it gets processed immediately.

Let's break down the mapping:

User Queue (Scheduled Requests): This is analogous to users queuing up to make a call. In a real system, this queue might be implicit (users pressing their PTT buttons and waiting), but our simulation makes it explicit. The scheduling based on time represents users planning future calls or delayed requests.

System Queue (Pending Requests/Channel Assignment): This is the core of the trunked radio system's logic. It represents the requests that are actively being considered for channel assignment.

Priority: The prioritization (Emergency, Priority, Normal) reflects how real systems give precedence to certain types of calls.
FCFS within Priority: Handling First-Come, First-Served within each priority level is also standard practice in trunked systems.
Channel Assignment: Our simulate_radio_system function and the RadioSystem class handle the allocation of channels, which is the primary function of a trunked radio system's control channel.
Blocking Queue (Blocked Requests/Queue for Channels): This represents the queue of calls that are waiting for a channel to become available. This is a crucial aspect of trunked systems. When all channels are busy, new requests are placed in a queue (implicitly or explicitly). Our blocking queue simulates this. The FIFO nature of the blocking queue ensures fairness â€“ users who have been waiting longer get priority when channels become free.

granted, denied, busy Responses: These responses from the simulate_radio_system function abstract the interaction with the actual radio hardware or control channel. This is a good simplification because it separates the queue management logic from the specifics of the radio system implementation.

Key Similarities to Real Trunked Systems:

Dynamic Channel Allocation: The system dynamically allocates channels to users as needed, which is the fundamental principle of trunking.
Priority and Preemption: The system handles different priority levels and ensures that higher-priority calls are handled promptly.
Queuing for Busy Channels: The blocking queue simulates the queuing of calls when all channels are in use.
