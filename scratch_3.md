Priority Handling on Unblock (Recommended): The best approach is to maintain the blocking queue as a simple FIFO queue (using deque for efficiency) but handle the priority when an item is unblocked. When an item is moved from the blocking queue back to the system queue, then you re-evaluate its priority and insert it into the system queue accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the flow and why it works as intended:

Item enters User Queue: It's scheduled based on the user-provided delay.

Item moves to System Queue: When the scheduled time arrives, the item is moved to the system queue, and its priority is initially assigned based on its arguments (EMERGENCY, PRIORITY, etc.).

System Queue Processing: The system queue processes items based on priority and submission time (FCFS within the same priority).

Blocking Condition: If an item in the system queue encounters a blocking condition (e.g., "BLOCK" command), it's moved to the Blocking Queue. Importantly, its original priority and submission time are stored along with it.

Unblocking: When the blocking condition is resolved (e.g., the timer expires), the item is removed from the Blocking Queue.

Re-evaluation and Re-entry to System Queue: This is the key step:

The item's priority is re-evaluated using the assign_system_priority function. This is crucial because the conditions that made the call an emergency (or any other priority) might have changed during the blocking period.
The item is then re-inserted into the system queue according to its new (or possibly same) priority and original submission time.
Potential Re-blocking: Now, here's where your question comes in: Yes, it's entirely possible that the re-inserted item might immediately encounter the blocking condition again. This could happen if the resource it needs is still unavailable. In this case, it would go back to the Blocking Queue.

Why this is good:

Priority is maintained: Even if an item is blocked multiple times, its priority is always re-evaluated upon unblocking, ensuring that high-priority items are not stuck behind lower-priority items.
No starvation: By re-evaluating the priority and re-inserting into the system queue, we avoid starvation. The item gets another chance to be processed based on its current priority relative to other items in the system queue.
Simple Blocking Queue: The Blocking Queue itself remains a simple FIFO queue, which is efficient for managing blocked items.
Example:

Imagine an EMERGENCY call is blocked because all channels are busy. While it's blocked, another EMERGENCY call comes in and is also blocked. When a channel finally opens up, the first EMERGENCY call (the one that has been waiting longer) is unblocked. Its priority is re-evaluated (it's likely still an EMERGENCY), and it's re-inserted into the system queue. Because it's now at the top of the system queue, it gets processed immediately.
